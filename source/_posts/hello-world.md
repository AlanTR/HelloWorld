#测试开始


People die. Things decay.Everything that seemed so solid is meaningless.All that left is gestures we make.Gestures and air, that's what we remember.
 	
We remember what we choose.
 		
In a week, there would be no trace of her. But what did it matter?
This wasn't the real world. We really only lived in each other's hearts.She lived in my heart, but I lived no where.I was all alone in the world.

You've burned every bridge,
You've worned out every welcome
and everyone who's ever believed in you.
You've let down.
 		
{% pullquote %}
Your world is as big as you make it.
I know, for I used to abide
in the narrowest nest in a corner,
My wings pressing close to my side.
{% endpullquote %}
 	
I knew when at that moment I had to make a choice.I could submit to everything that was happening in living life of excuses
or I could push myself.
I could push myself and make my life good.

 		
For the first time
my life had some order I can count on
What... what if I work even more?
I was so close to the skin
now I can touch it.
 		
The world moves you just suspect
it could no happen without you
situations are not condused to what you want for yourself
someone else's needs, someone else's plate is going to be stronger than yours is.
 		
I think people just get frustrated without harsh,
life can be
so they're spending their time dwelling on that frustration
 		
 		
 		
 		
I feel that I got lucky,
because any sensive security
was pulled out from under me
 so I was forced
to look forward.
I had to... there was no going back
